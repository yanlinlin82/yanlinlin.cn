I’m changing my life style in these days, for my dreams in the future.

I have a lot of beautiful dreams. The nearest one is entering the Peking University and going back to life science research. I’m working hard for it.

After graduation at 2003, I wasted too much time on writing lots of useless program. I left myself to falling into the boring abyss. Now it’s time to wake up.

There is only half year to the exam. The largest difficulty is not the professional course, which is covered with dust in these 5 years, but the English language. In my opinion, because of the science history, the best language for explaining modern science is western language, especially English. But unfortunately, I have never learned it well.

Nowadays, with the spirit of opening source and respect for intellectual property, I changed my OS from Windows to Ubuntu, which is a very amazing Linux version. And of course, I installed the English version, for adapting myself to a new English environment. Google and Wikipedia are the websites I visit most frequently. I found that it’s very nice to get understanding of a term from its English explaining.

Why didn’t you start realizing this earlier, ’cause if you did, I wouldn’t be the only one who was blamed for mixing English words in daily conversations :D . Anyway, this is a good start and keep on learning and going.
