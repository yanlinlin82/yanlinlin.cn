I like the word: **programming is a precise science**. After using C++ for years, it has become one of my habits to try to known every piece of code that I am telling the computer. Sometimes, third-part libraries, including some APIs from OS, tend to bring our program some strange behaviors, especially from unfamiliar usage. Under the circumstances, it often feels like skating on very thin ice and far away from the “precise science”, which is not what I want. In this era, however, it is neither a wise way, nor, moreover, a possible way to write everything by oneself. So, in conclusion, being a perfectionist is sorrowful, very very sorrowful.
