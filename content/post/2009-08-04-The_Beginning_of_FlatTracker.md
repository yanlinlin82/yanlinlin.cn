So far I have finished the basic function of FlatTracker and uploaded it to Google Code (<http://code.google.com/p/flattracker/>).

This is a plugin for TortoriseSVN and a very lightweight issue tracker for software developing. I try to avoid the relational database and other third-part software except Subversion itself.

It now can record and associate issues with commits of Subversion. However, there is a long way to make this little tool robust and convenient for daily use. And I will keep on improving it.
