Finally, I have migrated SeqPipe from [Google Code] to [GitHub].

[Google Code]: http://code.google.com/p/seqpipe/
[GitHub]: http://github.com/yanlinlin82/seqpipe/

For a long while, I used subversion for version control in software development, until I tried decentralized git system two years ago, and found it more attractive to me.

Tonight, when I tried to sync code of SeqPipe from google code, the connection became unstable again. It pushed me to finish the migration.
